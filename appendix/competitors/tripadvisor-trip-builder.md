### Strengths

- Uses tripadvisors database to seek stuff to do, and has more customised options for the different locations (e.g. bike tours in Amsterdam) when entering your preferences
- Once the itinerary is made (by AI) it seems you can then use the app to walk and go through all the activities
- The activities are close together to make it actually possible to walk between them (but I didn’t input my hotel in there so idk how it chose the start)
- You choose the stuff you want to do and the itinerary will try to include as many as possible.

### Weaknesses

- No flight recommendations
- There are no specific time allocations, just basic Location → Food → Location → Food → Location structure - tbh though this could be a strength
- No AI to help you editing, anything after its generated has to be all manual
- Doesn’t book anything it recommends, you must do that yourself.
