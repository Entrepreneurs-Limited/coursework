Although not built for this purpose, ChatGPT etc can be used to create travel plans (have seen example prompts on social media)

### Strengths

- Most already have an account, very easy, like talking to a human (ish)

### Weaknesses

- Not purpose built, will not have lots of features ours will (e.g. book flights for you)
- hallucinations

There have also been custom versions see:
