### Strengths

- Conversational feel, achieved using LLMs
- Can suggest locations and itineraries
- Can find flights and accommodation
- Can reserve accommodation through [Booking.com](http://Booking.com) directly, as it’s directly integrated with Booking.com’s interface

### Weaknesses

- Doesn’t store personal preferences - has to be explicitly told them for each booking
- Though it can give you ideas for an itinerary, it’s fairly limited in this way - it doesn’t include our planned feature of having a map to show you the locations of different activities or suggest routes between them
