### Strengths

- Has option to input budget (however minimum is 0-1000)
- Have the option to put if you want vegetarian options ðŸ¤¯
- Recommends hotels - links directly to booking.com, also has the option to easily find accommodation for each day separately
- All recommendations for itinerary have links to book (through other websites though)
- Gives some paragraphs of the location, with the history (quite cool)

### Weaknesses

- No flights
- No personalised recommendations based on the hotel location
- Loves to recommend food places (like I got 2 food stops right next to each other totaling 4 hours to spend there)
