### Strengths

- You can set budget + pace, and if you want vegan food
- Personalises based off of hotels (but it doesn’t show prices when listing hotels)
- It is extremely detailed and includes distances you have to travel
- Alternatives can be listed for each section of the journey allowing you to easily swap it out with something else
- If something is ticketed and requires booking, it gives you a direct link to make it easy

### Weaknesses

- The options to show your interests are v limited, (with food options for me being Vegan or Pizza)
- Doesn’t book things for you
- In general seems a bit early access (but it is quite well specked out)
- Does plan the same things for multiple days (but only for like food and stuff and it does label it quite clearly)
- Weirdly didn’t give me recommendations for the actual place I asked for but idk if that was just me messing it up
