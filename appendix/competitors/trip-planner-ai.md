### Strengths

- Have a “person” help you (e.g. gives chatbot a name and picture, feels more human, more trust)
    - chatbot is kinda funny
- Autofill prompt based on what you’re typing (e.g. changes after you write “paris”)
- personalised Itinerary for location, including hotels
    - can change

### Weaknesses

- Need to pay to see full itinerary ($79.99 / month)
- Only plans time at destination (not how to get there)
