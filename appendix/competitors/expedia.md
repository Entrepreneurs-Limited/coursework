### Strengths

- Large variety of hotels available to search, can prioritise by feature (view, parking, …), price, area, rating
- Can book AirBNB esk places
- Includes option to add flights, timed with hotel bookings
- Included built in reviews system which enhances trust
- Can book airport transfer
- ‘Things to do’ section allows you to enter a time and place. It will list popular things to do in the area for those dates and their costs. Can book tickets through the app
- You have actual control of what you book, no AI hallucinations

### Weaknesses

- You have to decide where you want to go (I don’t really see this as a weakness but in the context of our idea it is)
- ‘Things to do’ section does not include things which are free
- Includes custom ‘AI’ chatbot to provide additional information on the hotel, very limited, does not give any response to “what are some things to do for free in the area”
