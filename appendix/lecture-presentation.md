# Lecture Presentation

Notes from presenting Konsu in a lecture to Bhagy and other students.

- The idea is good, people would be likely to use the product and could relate to the problems that we mentioned
- Only criticism given was that our logo resembles the Starbucks logo too much - we should take action to change this before launching the product
