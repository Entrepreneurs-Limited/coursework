# Bhagy Meeting

Notes from meeting with Bhagy to present and discuss our product idea.

- Idea is solid, has potential and was a relatable problem
- We’re on the right track with the work we’re doing
- Need to make sure we focus on user experience, using HCI methodologies
- Don’t be discouraged by similar ideas - we can still stand out with good user interaction and functionality
- Emphasis on having other people evaluate our user interface during development
- Note - would be good to present in the lecture once sign-ups open
